# What is a quadrature optical encoder?

- Sensor for tracking rotational position and direction
- Uses two output channels (A and B) offset by 90 degrees
- Optical disk with alternating opaque/transparent sections
- LED light source and photodetector generate signals

# Why are they needed?

- Precise position and speed measurement
- Direction detection (clockwise vs. counterclockwise)
- Feedback control in various applications
- User input for rotary controls[^1][^3]

# High speed issues

- Signal frequency increases with speed and resolution
- Example: 2000 pulses/rev at 2000 RPM ≈ 67 kHz
- Microcontrollers may struggle to keep up with high-frequency signals
- Interrupts and software-based counting become unreliable[^10]

---

# Few open-source encoder counter boards right now

- Limited availability of dedicated hardware solutions
- Most implementations rely on microcontroller interrupts
- Gap in the market for high-speed, open-source encoder counter boards

---

# What is I2C?

- Inter-Integrated Circuit communication protocol
- Two-wire interface: SDA (data) and SCL (clock)
- Allows multiple devices on the same bus
- Simple and widely supported in electronics[^6]

---

# What is Qwiic/STEMMA?

- Standardized connectors for I2C devices
- Qwiic (SparkFun) and STEMMA QT (Adafruit) are compatible
- 4-pin JST SH connector (3.3V, GND, SDA, SCL)
- Simplifies prototyping and reduces errors[^6][^7]

# No available Qwiic/STEMMA high-speed encoder counters

- Current gap in the Qwiic/STEMMA ecosystem
- Opportunity for development of a dedicated encoder counter
- Would simplify integration of high-speed encoders in projects
- Potential to address limitations of software-based counting
