# What is a quadrature optical encoder?

- Sensor for tracking rotational position and direction
- Uses two output channels (A and B) offset by 90 degrees
- Optical disk with alternating opaque/transparent sections
- LED light source and photodetector generate signals

# How does an optical encoder work?

- Direction of rotation determined by phase relationship
- Counting pulses on both channels gives position and direction

# Where are optical encoders used?

## Low-speed applications
- User input for rotary controls

# Where are optical encoders used?

## High-speed applications
- Precise position, speed, and direction sensing for motors
    - motor &#43; encoder = servo
    - closed-loop motor control

# High speed issues

- Signal frequency increases with speed and resolution
- If using two GPIO pins to watch the A and B signals, microcontroller may miss pulses
    - Microcontroller still handling previous pulse when next pulse arrives
- Example: 
    - 2000 pulses/rev at 2,000 RPM * 2 detectors ≈ 133 kHz, or 7.5 µs per pulse
    - If microcontroller takes longer than 7.5 µs to process a pulse, it will miss the next one

# Solution:  Use dedicated hardware

- Encoder counter circuit with hardware quadrature decoding
- Counts pulses on A and B signals
- Figures out direction of rotation from phase relationship
- Uses pulse count and direction to maintain a position counter
- Microcontroller reads position counter by some method -- I2C, SPI, serial, etc.

# The missing piece

- Open-source encoder counter boards are rare
    - This causes the Maker and open hardware community to use
      open-loop control for motors
    - e.g. most 3D printers are open-loop
- Even bigger gap for boards compatible with Qwiic/STEMMA ecosystem
  from SparkFun and Adafruit
    - Qwiic/STEMMA is a standardized connector for I2C devices
- No Qwiic/STEMMA encoder counter boards known to exist as of this
  writing
    - This makes closed-loop prototyping harder than it should be

# What is I2C?

- Inter-Integrated Circuit communication protocol
- Two-wire interface: SDA (data) and SCL (clock)
- Allows multiple devices on the same bus
- Simple and widely supported
    - many microcontrollers have I2C hardware
    - your laptop uses I2C internally to talk to the trackpad, keyboard, etc.

# What is Qwiic/STEMMA?

- Connectors for I2C devices standardized by SparkFun and Adafruit
- Qwiic (SparkFun) and STEMMA QT (Adafruit) are compatible with each
  other
- 4-pin JST SH connector (3.3V, GND, SDA, SCL)
- Speeds up prototyping by eliminating soldering and breadboarding

# Many, many available Qwiic/STEMMA microcontroller boards

SparkFun, Adafruit, and others now make many boards with Qwiic/STEMMA connectors:

- Microcontrollers
  - Arduino-compatible
  - Adafruit Feather and QT Py series
  - Teensy with STEMMA QT adapter
  - Raspberry Pi with STEMMA QT hat

- Peripherals, Sensors, and Displays
  - CO2
  - temperature, humidity, pressure
  - motion (accelerometers, gyroscopes)
  - light

# Qwiic/STEMMA encoder counter

- LSI Logic has a 32-bit counter chip with quadrature decoding and I2C interface (LS7866)
- So we designed a board around it
- Uses Qwiic/STEMMA connectors for easy integration
- Like any Qwiic/STEMMA device, it can be daisy-chained
    - Multiple encoders can be used on the same I2C bus
    - Same bus can be shared with other devices like sensors, displays, etc.
